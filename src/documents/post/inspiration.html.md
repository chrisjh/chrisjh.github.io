Why am I making a blog? Well, there are a couple of reasons I've decided to take up blogging. Some of which are related to my real life while others are pretty irrelevant wants I had in regards to programming. That also sums up the theme of this blog and its tag line - <i>thought snippets on life and tech.</i> Let's start with the latter:

* [Pure CSS](http://purecss.io) is awesome. I've been itching to use it for a while now but had not yet found the right use-case. Now I have - this blog.

* [DocPad](http://docpad.org) is also pretty neat. I started out looking at [Octopress](http://octopress.org) but decided to go with DocPad instead, mainly because I'm partial to Node.js. Definitely check them both out for yourself. 

What is the real reason for all this though? Truthfully, my good friend David Idol. 

We met this past year while taking a game development course together. We were thrown into a group as total strangers and emerged with an awesome game and an even more awesome friendship. David taught me more about programming - really, the art of programming - than I have ever learned from any of my coursework. He has such incredible talent and a great work ethic that has inspired me to take on projects and ideas I would never have dreamed I could do before. 

His inspiration also spilled over into the blog. A few weeks ago I saw that he had a new blog - and it was awesome. Naturally, I wondered, "how did he do it?" This led to that and I found that he was using [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/). Of course I then thought to myself, "I should make a blog, too..." The story can be rounded out by the irony presented by his Github user name, [idolize](http://github.com/idolize).

Be sure to check him out on [Github](http://github.com/idolize) and on his [personal blog](http://idolize.github.io). Keep a look out for collaborations from us in the future!
